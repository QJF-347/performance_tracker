Yes! We can build a **Student Performance Recommendation Model** using **machine learning (ML) and rule-based insights**. This model will analyze a student's performance and generate **personalized feedback** like:  
âœ… **"Your low attendance is causing failure in subjects."**  
âœ… **"You perform better in subjects with high participation."**  
âœ… **"Improving assignment scores can boost your final exam performance."**  

---

### **Approach to Building the Model**  
We'll combine:  
ðŸ”¹ **Rule-Based Analysis** (if attendance < 50%, flag it as an issue)  
ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning (ML) Insights** (predict key performance factors using AI)  
ðŸ”¹ **Natural Language Generation** (to generate human-like feedback)

## **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install required libraries:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn transformers torch
```

---

## **Step 2: Define the Input Features**
We'll use the following student performance metrics:  
- **Attendance (0-20%)**  
- **Participation (0-20%)**  
- **Assignment Score (0-10)**  
- **Year of Study (1-6)**  
- **Number of Subjects Taken (1-7)**  
- **Class Size (40-200 students)**  
- **Peer Performance (0-100%)**  
- **CATS (Continuous Assessment Tests) (0-40)**  
- **RATS (Random Assessment Tests) (0-10)**  
- **Final Exam Score (0-100)**

## **Step 3: Define the Rules for Basic Recommendations**
ðŸ“Œ **`analytics/recommender.py`**  
```python
import numpy as np

def generate_recommendations(student_data):
    """
    Analyzes student performance and provides personalized recommendations.
    
    :param student_data: Dictionary containing student metrics
    :return: List of recommendations
    """
    recommendations = []

    # Low Attendance Issue
    if student_data["attendance"] < 5:
        recommendations.append("Your low attendance is significantly impacting your performance. Try attending more classes.")

    # Low Participation Issue
    if student_data["participation"] < 5:
        recommendations.append("Active participation in class can improve your understanding and final grades.")

    # Assignment Completion Issue
    if student_data["assignment_score"] < 4:
        recommendations.append("Completing more assignments can boost your continuous assessment scores.")

    # Peer Performance Influence
    if student_data["peer_performance"] > 75 and student_data["final_exam"] < 50:
        recommendations.append("Your peers are performing well. Try engaging in group discussions to improve.")

    # Low Exam Performance
    if student_data["final_exam"] < 40:
        recommendations.append("Your final exam score is low. Consider reviewing past papers and consulting your teacher.")

    return recommendations
```

---

## **Step 4: Train a Machine Learning Model for Predictions**  
ðŸ“Œ **Using `RandomForestRegressor` to predict final performance.**  

ðŸ“Œ **`analytics/ml_model.py`**  
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
import joblib

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("student_performance.csv")  # Ensure you have a dataset

# Define input features and target variable
features = ["attendance", "participation", "assignment_score", "year_of_study", 
            "num_subjects", "class_size", "peer_performance", "cats", "rats"]
target = "final_exam"

X = df[features]
y = df[target]

# Split dataset into training & test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model MAE: {mae:.2f}")

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, "performance_predictor.pkl")
```

---

## **Step 5: Combine ML & Rule-Based Recommendations**
ðŸ“Œ **`analytics/predictor.py`**  
```python
import joblib
from analytics.recommender import generate_recommendations

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load("performance_predictor.pkl")

def analyze_student_performance(student_data):
    """
    Predicts final exam score & generates insights.
    
    :param student_data: Dictionary containing student metrics
    :return: Predicted score & recommendations
    """
    features = ["attendance", "participation", "assignment_score", "year_of_study",
                "num_subjects", "class_size", "peer_performance", "cats", "rats"]
    
    # Convert input to ML model format
    input_data = [[student_data[feature] for feature in features]]
    
    # Predict final exam score
    predicted_score = model.predict(input_data)[0]

    # Generate recommendations
    recommendations = generate_recommendations(student_data)

    return {
        "predicted_final_exam_score": round(predicted_score, 2),
        "recommendations": recommendations
    }
```

---

## **Step 6: Create an API to Serve Recommendations**
ðŸ“Œ **`analytics/views.py`**  
```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .predictor import analyze_student_performance

@api_view(["POST"])
def student_recommendation(request):
    """
    API to analyze student performance and return personalized insights.
    """
    student_data = request.data  # Expecting JSON input
    result = analyze_student_performance(student_data)
    return Response(result)
```

ðŸ“Œ **`analytics/urls.py`**  
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import student_recommendation

urlpatterns = [
    path("recommendations/", student_recommendation, name="student-recommendation"),
]
```

---

## **Step 7: Testing the Model**
Start Django server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
### **Send a request via Postman or cURL:**
#### **ðŸ“Œ Example Input**
```json
{
    "attendance": 4,
    "participation": 3,
    "assignment_score": 5,
    "year_of_study": 2,
    "num_subjects": 5,
    "class_size": 80,
    "peer_performance": 60,
    "cats": 30,
    "rats": 7
}
```
#### **ðŸ“Œ Example Output**
```json
{
    "predicted_final_exam_score": 45.3,
    "recommendations": [
        "Your low attendance is significantly impacting your performance. Try attending more classes.",
        "Active participation in class can improve your understanding and final grades."
    ]
}
```
